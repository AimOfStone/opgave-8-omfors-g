FrankenText

This code is supposed to randomly generate a sentence from randomly picked out tokens from the book Frankenstein. I could not get it to work.

I remove the non-printable chars and replace them with a space
We find the delimiters ( \n\r) //I dont know how to commit changes. I Am using the wrong delimiters
connect each token to the next
Print a randomly generated sentence (from the tokens/book) based off of the delimiters
